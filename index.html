            <p> My aspiration to live creativity and meet people’s actual needs
                  when it comes to media consumption led me to complete my
                  Bachelor’s in Graphic Design. My aim is always to combine a
                  pragmatic approach with aesthetics, while improving communication
                  between people. As a Fulbright scholar, I completed my studies
                  abroad with an MA at the Savannah College of Art and Design, which
                  ultimately helped me to get my foot into the world of fashion and
                  luxury communication. As a believer in sustainable practices, my
                  thesis focused on developing the brand identity and communication
                  of a clean beauty pop-up store under the umbrella of Selfridges.</p>
